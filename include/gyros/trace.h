/** \defgroup trace_group Tracing support
  *
  * Tracing is enabled when compiled with @c GYROS_CONFIG_TRACE set to
  * a non-zero value.  When tracing is enabled, task activities,
  * e.g. context switches, and synchronization object interactions,
  * e.g. locking and unlocking of mutexes are logged with time stamps.
  * These log entries can be recalled to study the real time behavior
  * of a program.
  *
  * Before tracing can be enabled, a memory area must be reserved to
  * store the trace log.  The address and size of the memory area is
  * supplied when calling gyros_trace_init().  Tracing is enabled and
  * disabled by the running software.  When disabling tracing, there
  * is an option to perform a number of additional traces before
  * really stopping, which can be useful to study events up to and
  * just after a certain condition occurs.
