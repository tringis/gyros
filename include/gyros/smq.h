  * \defgroup smq_group Static message queues
  *
  * A static message queue is used to send small messages between
  * tasks.  The contents of the messages is application defined.
  * Messages are sent to the queue using gyros_smq_send() and received
  * from the queue using gyros_smq_receive() or
  * gyros_smq_receive_until().
  *
  * The message queue must be initialized before use using
  * gyros_smq_init().
  *
  * Message data is copied both when sendind and receiving, which is
  * why the messages should be kept small.
