/** \defgroup rwlock_group Read/write locks
  *
  * A read/write lock (rwlock) allows multiple read locks
  * simultaneously, but write locks are exclusive, locking out all
  * other readers and writers.
  *
  * A read/write lock must be initialized before use, either using
  * GYROS_RWLOCK_INITVAL() when defining the read/write lock, or using
  * gyros_rwlock_init().
  *
  * Read/write locks are not recursive, so calling a lock function
  * twice (without calling gyros_rwlock_unlock() inbetween) from the
  * same task will result in a deadlock.
  *
