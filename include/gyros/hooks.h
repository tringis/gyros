  *
  * Hooks are used to call custom code for certain internal gyros
  * events such as interrupts and context switches.  While the hooks
  * are designed to be efficient, there is a performance penalty,
  * which is why hook support is disabled by default.
  *
  * GyrOS must be compiled with @c GYROS_CONFIG_CONTEXT_HOOK set to a
  * non-zero value to enable support for the context switch hook, and
  * @c GYROS_CONFIG_IRQ_HOOK must be set to a non-zero value to enable
  * the IRQ hook.
