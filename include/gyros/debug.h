  *
  * Debugging is enabled by setting \ref GYROS_CONFIG_DEBUG to a
  * non-zero value in gyros/config.h.  When debugging is
  * enabled, many common invalid uses of the GyrOS API is detected,
  * and more information about the status of each task tracked,
  * e.g. if a task is blocking on a mutex, and if so, which mutex.
  * Errors are reported using the standard
  * \ref error_group "error handling" module.
