  * \brief Task management.
  * \details Header file for \ref task_group.
  *
  * \defgroup task_group Task management
  *
  * Tasks are described by a task struct called gyros_task_t which is
  * initialized by gyros_task_create().  The task struct is used to
  * store the state of the task when it is not running.  Tasks can be
  * created, suspended, resumed, deleted, and waited for.  Every task
  * has a main function, and if the task returns from this function it
  * will be deleted automatically.  That is the normal way for a task
  * to be deleted.
  *
  * Each task can be either running or suspended, optionally with a
  * timeout that will cause it to become running again after a certain
  * time has been reached.  Each task also has a priority assigned to
  * it, and only the running task with the higher priority is allowed
  * to execute.  If there are more than one task having the highest
  * priority, the one executing will be allowed to execute until it
  * either calls gyros_yield(), or becomes suspended (by blocking on a
  * synchronization object or calls a sleeping function).
  *
  * Also associated with each task is a name used for debugging
  * purposes, and a stack.
  *
  * Here's an example of task creation:
  * \code
  * gyros_task_t task1;
  * char task1_stack[128];
  *
  * static void task1_main(void *arg)
  * {
  *     ...
  * }
  * 
  * void create_task(void)
  * {
  *     gyros_task_create(&task1, "task1", task1_main, 0,
  *                       task1_stack, sizeof(task1_stack), 1);
  * }
  * \endcode
  *
  * @{
