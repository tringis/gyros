  *
  * When a fatal error is detected by GyrOS, an error handling
  * callback function is called, with a string describing the error as
  * first argument, and an object pointer as second argument.  The
  * meaning of the object pointer depends on the error message, but is
  * normally obvious.  If the error is that there's a mutex deadlock,
  * the pointer points to the mutex causing the deadlock, etc.
  *
  * The callback is implemented by the application, and is typically
  * prints an error message and stops or resets the CPU.  If a
  * callback is not set, GyrOS just disables all interrupts and hangs
  * the CPU.
  *

/** Set the error handler to @a msg. The default error handler just
  * hangs forever in a loop with interrupts disabled.  The error
  * handler is called with two parameters, both a text message
  * describing the error, and a pointer to the object relevant to the
  * error, e.g. a pointer to the mutex when a mutex error is detected,
  * or a task when a task error is detected, or @c NULL when there is
  * no relevant object.
  *
