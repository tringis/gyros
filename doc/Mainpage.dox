/** \mainpage GyrOS Documentation

GyrOS is an open source portable real time operating system (RTOS)
with an easy to use C API.  It is easy to port to new platforms,
partly because it is written in C, but mostly because the bits that
must be ported are few and clearly defined.

\section features Features
- Easy to \ref porting "port" to new architectures.
- Preemtive \ref task_group "multitasking".
- Small memory footprint (both code and RAM).
- Low power consumption thanks to dynamic timers.
- \ref debug_group to catch common usage errors and see current task status.
- Several synchronization techniques:
  - \ref sem_group (binary or counting)
  - \ref mutex_group (mutex) with priority inheritance
  - \ref cond_group
  - \ref rwlock_group
  - Task \ref gyros_task_suspend "suspend" and \ref gyros_task_resume
    "resume"
- Permissive BSD-style \subpage license "license" allowing for both commercial and
  non-commercial use.

\section supported_hw Supported hardware

ARM based:
- Atmel AT91SAM7S (ARM7TDMI core)
- STMicroelectronics STR91x (ARM966E-S core)
