/** \page building Building GyrOS

GyrOS is easy to build, and can be built using most build systems,
such as make, SCons or even an integrated development environment like
Eclipse.  It can be build like a library to be used by multiple
applications, or it can be copied into the application build
structure, depending on what suits the application best.

The only requirement on the build system is that it needs to configure
the search path for include files so that both generic include files
(like \c gyros/task.h) and target specific include files (like \c
gyros/target/interrupt.h) are found.  Note that application code
should never include target specific include files, but the include
path does need to be set up so that the target specific files can be
found by GyrOS internal files.

Here's an example of the command line when building using a GCC
cross-compiler:

\verbatim
arm-elf-gcc -I gyros-1.0/include -I gyros-1.0/port/at91sam7s/include \
    gyros-1.0/src/sem.c -o gyros-1.0/src/sem.o
\endverbatim
