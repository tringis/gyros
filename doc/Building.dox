/** \page building Building GyrOS

GyrOS is easy to build, and can be built using most build systems,
such as make, SCons or an integrated development environment like
Eclipse.  It can be built as a library to be used by multiple
applications, or it can be copied directly into the application build
structure, depending on what suits the application best.

In order to build and application using GyrOS, you will need a
development platform for your target microcontroller, including a
standard C library, and startup code to initialize your
microcontroller.

While the GyrOS core is 100% standard C, the target ports all contain
some assembly files and/or compiler specific C code.  All current
target ports are for the GNU toolchain, which is Open Source and is
available for a vast number of CPU:s, and runs on all major host
platforms.  The target specific code is on the other hand very little
code, so it's not too hard to port to another development platform if
needed.

Each port has one or more examples that can be very useful when
starting to use GyrOS.  There's also example startup code available
for each target, but it's likely going to require changes to properly
initialize the hardware on the real target.  Initialization of clocks,
memories and so on will likely vary from board to board.

\section building_example Building an example application

As first example, we will build the supplied examples for the STR91x
microcontroller family.  The name of this port is str91x, and it
written for the GNU toolchain, and uses SCons as the build system.

The example contains the following files:
- \c SConstruct - SCons build file ("Makefile").  Edit this file
  to find your GNU toolchain commands, and to generate ARM THUMB
  code or not.
- \c str91x.ld - Link script.
- \c include/gyros/target/config.h - GyrOS configuration file.  Edit
  this file to support time conversion functions, and to enable and
  disable optional features.
- \c hwinit.c - Hardware initialization code.  Edit this file to
  make the example run on your board.
- \c startup.S - Startup code.
- \c test.c - The actual test application.

This simple example just creates two tasks of different priorities,
one in a tight loop, and the other in a loop around a sleep call.  The
example is build from the command line like this:

\verbatim
> cd targets/str91x/examples
> scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
...
scons: done building targets.
> arm-elf-size test.elf
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   6160	     96	    688	   6944	   1b20	test.elf
> 
\endverbatim

The size of the binary includes the C runtime, and this example has
both debugging and tracing enabled which increases the size of the
binary.

\section building_app Building a real application using SCons

Building a real application using SCons is very easy.  Let's say that
we want to build an application called blinky.  A convenient directory
structure for an application is to put gyros in a top level directory,
and the application code in another top level directory, which we will
call \c src in this example.  We can initialize the src directory by
copying the example directory, and then edit the SConstruct file to
fix the CPPPATH and the path to the SConscript file.

\section building_other Building using another build system

For the rest of this section, let's assume that the GyrOS top level
directory is \c $GYROS.  This is the directory containing the
directories \c doc, \c include, \c src, \c targets and the file \c
LICENSE.  Let's also assume that we're building for an STR912 CPU.
The port for this CPU is called \c str91x.  If you're building for
another port, just replace \c str91x with the name of your port.

\subsection building_other_includepath Include paths

The build system must configure the search path to find both the core
include files and the port specific include files.  Since all GyrOS
include files (external and internal) are prefixed by \c gyros/, the
build system must add the directory containing the \c gyros directory,
and not the \c gyros directory itself.  For our example, it means that
the following directories should be added:

- \c $GYROS/include
- \c $GYROS/targets/<em>str91x</em>/include

Here's an example of the command line when building using a GCC
cross-compiler:

\verbatim
arm-elf-gcc -I $GYROS/include -I $GYROS/targets/str91x/include -c file.c
\endverbatim

\subsection building_other_config Configuration file

GyrOS exects to find a configuration include file, included by GyrOS
internally using the name \c gyros/target/config.h.  A template for
this configuration file is available in the examples for your target
port.

\subsection building_other_srcs Source files

The build system must build all files in the \c src directory and
below, and also the target specific files, which in the case of the
str91x target means all source files in the \c targets/str91x
directory.  The port may also require common architecture code.  The
str91x target is an ARM target, so all source files in the \c
targets/arm must be built as well.
